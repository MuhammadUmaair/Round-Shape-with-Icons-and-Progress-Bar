## Features
- A circular container with clickable icons positioned at the top, right, bottom, and left.
- Smooth transitions and animated movement for the progress arc.
- Responsive and adaptable design, ensuring it works on different screen sizes.

## Demo
### Live Demo (optional)
You can check the live version of this project [Round Shape with Icons and Progress Bar](https://muhammadumaair.github.io/Round-Shape-with-Icons-and-Progress-Bar/).

## How It Works
This project uses a progress bar that rotates around the edges of a circle when an icon is clicked. The circle is divided into four quadrants: **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left**, each corresponding to a 90-degree rotation of the arc.

### Interaction Flow:
1. Initially, the progress bar arc is positioned at the **top** (0 degrees).
2. When the user clicks on the **right** icon, the arc rotates 90 degrees to the **right**.
3. Clicking the **bottom** icon rotates the arc another 90 degrees to the **bottom**.
4. Clicking the **left** icon moves it 90 degrees further to the **left**.
5. The progress bar arc animates smoothly between these positions.
